The installation is composed of a visual element and a soundtrack.</p>
<br />
<p>The visuals are composed of three sequences of 10 photos, that are projected on three glass plates. The glass plates are mounted suspended in the air and one in fron of the other, so that the images of the three sequences overlap.
The film here shown is a rough representation of what the result on the glass plates would be.</p>
<br />
<p>The soundtrack is composed of individual sounds mixed together, and is reproduced in a 5.1 audio system.</p>
<br />
<p>The aim of the installation is to create movement artificially, both visually and through sound. What you are seing is 10 photos shot over the period of 10 seconds. For each of them the shutter has been kept open for 1 whole second. The screen is vertically split in 3, to include a past, future and present second at all times. The deconstructed and reconstructed movement shows that movement cannot be created between images.</p>
