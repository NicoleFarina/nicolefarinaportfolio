  <br />
This is the second short film I ever shot.</p>
<br />
<p>It is unfinished and is part of a series of interviews about social perceptions and constructions.</p>
<br />
<p>This is an example of a failed project, as all the footage and material has been lost due to bad media handling. In fact, this is the lighting check up that was edited as a mock teaser trailer.</p>
<br />
<p>I wanted to include this work because it shows my interest in social issues and in political use of the media, since the very beginning. It was a project that was very dear to me and that was very painful to loose. However, other than the importance of being carefull with recorded media, it taught me to be mindful of my work, not only for my sake but also for the audience and the work of the people around me.</p>
